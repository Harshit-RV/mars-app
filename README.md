# MARS

The idea is to provide the already freely available unorganised data (regarding Mars) in an
organised, simple, user-friendly and understandable format.

MARS: Everything We Know app is your one-stop for knowledge about the red planet. You can check the latest weather data recorded at 3 different locations on Mars by differentlanding rovers. You can see the latest surface images clicked by different Mars rovers sent by NASA. You can listen to the latest audios from Mars. You can see how Mars compares to Earth on factors such as temperature, pressure, gravity, atmosphere, etc. There’s a special section in the app called “An Astronaut’s Guide to living on Mars” which lists down random and interesting facts about Mars.

## Features in Development:

- Information about past missions and their conclusions
- Querying and searching images and audios from Mars
- Information about different Mars rovers
- Future missions planned for Mars
- And many more… (open to suggestions)
